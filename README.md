```pollination```
- pollen from male plants can be used to fertilize female plants, which will produce a mix of female/male seeds

```pollen harvesting```
- special machinery required for pollen harvesting provides a barrier to entry, ensuring that innate game difficulty is not lost

```pollinated flower```
- flower obtained from pollinated plants will be low quality, and is unable to be sold. it must be trashed or smoked, but can have negative side effects if smoked
